# Licensing Terms

The works of art in this folder are governed by the following terms, **which were negotiated between Kat and The Quilt 
Project.** They **do not grant any permissions to anyone** other than Quilt Project staff members, when representing 
The Quilt Project in a strictly official manner - in official Quilt Project community spaces, on
[the official Quilt Project website](https://quiltmc.org), and on official Quilt Project social media accounts.

The **only** exception to this rule is when you're linking to Quilt Project accounts and pages in other places on the
Internet. If you're working with a social media network (such as Twitter) that provides previews of the links you're
posting, it's OK if those previews include commissioned artwork included on the page you're linking to.

The following table is taken from an older version of [Kat's commissions Carrd](https://digital-whiskers.carrd.co).
Remember, these terms only affect The Quilt Project - unless you're on the Community Team or Admin Board and acting
in a strictly official manner, **these terms do not apply to you, and you have no rights to use the works of art for
anything.**
